# redhat-release
A release repository for the BoxCycler Release systems, found on the
Vagrant Cloud at https://app.vagrantup.com/boxcycler/ . . .

I found inspiration for some of this content from the Boxcutter Project
and other miscellaneous examples and content found on the web.

These systems are built completely offline from checksummed ISO release
distributions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  As part of post-processing,
the components are rearranged on the system to enable a DVD drive and set
the network to general NAT usage.  They are my source, or starting point,
for building specialized systems using Packer and other tools.
